# Camera Assembly

The two degree of freedom camera mount is probably the most complicated component:

* Believe it or not, the hardest part for me is to peel off the cover paper from all the flat pieces!

* You need to use the tapping screws, i.e. the pointy ones, to attach the servo arms to the flat plastic pieces of the assembly. Double check to see which whole in the servo arm (the soft wight plastic piece) aligns with which hole in the flat piece before screwing. The screw will bite into the servo arm and you do not want to use the wrong hole.
