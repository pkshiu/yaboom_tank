 # Introduction

 This set of documentation will help you assemble and program the [Yahboom "Tank" kit](https://amzn.to/2Qdmi13) powered by a Raspberry Pi (not included in the kit).

 This kits is a very complete kit that includes the tank chassis, motorized, with servos, moving sonar sensor, two DF camera, line tracker, and more. However the documentation and software that come with the kit is lacking. I hope you find these documentation here helpful.

 ## Before You Start Assembly

 Some tips before you get started:

 1. There are a lot of screws, nuts, and standoffs of various sizes. Try to keep them in the respective plastic bags because they are grouped together for different components.

 2. Have a ruler with mm scale ready. Learn to read screws and standoffs specification from the instruction sheet: M2.5x8 means a screw or standoffs that have a 2.5 diameter. The 8 means the screw is 8 mm long, excluding the head of the screw.

 3. Double and tripple check that you are using the right screws. Some places there are no spare screws left if you used the wrong ones. There will be some left over at the end.

 4. The instruction sheet, in some area, shows different assembly if you have purchased the ardiuno version or the raspberry Pi version. Read them carefully.

5. Get a good phillips screwdriver with a magnetized head. While it is good for the kit to include a screwdriver, you want one that is of higher quality. A pair of tweezers will also help sometimes to hold on to nut or a screw. [Adafruit sells a set](https://www.adafruit.com/product/424). Or some [generic ones](https://amzn.to/2VOzWh7) from Amazon. I have my set since high school so these are just suggestions.

6. The instructions are correct even thought sometimes you think something is not right. The "design sketches" are particularly useful in figuring out what goes where. Just have some patience and double check that you are using the right size screws and standoffs.
